// ------------- DESIGN -------------
/* 
Program Name: Rock Collector

Program Description: This program replicate a competetion where three players collect rocks. 
The user is prompted to enter names of the players and number of rocks they collected.
Then the program validates rock counts, ranks the players and displays the winners in order.
At the end the program calculates and displays the average number of rocks collected.

Design:
A. INPUT
player1 as string
player2 as string
player3 as string
rockCounts1 as int 
rockCounts2 as int 
rockCounts3 as int 

B. OUTPUT
average as double 
firstPlace as string 
secondPlace as string
thirdPlace as string

C. CALCULATIONS

Ties and placing: 
Three players tie if all three rock counts are equal;
Two players tie for first, and the third is second if two players have equal and highest rock counts;
If there are no ties we'll use if/else logic to determine who has the highest count and assign him to firstPlace;
Compare the other two to assign secondPlace and thirdPlace.

average = (rocksCount1 + rocksCount2 + rocksCount3) / 3.0;

D. LOGIC and ALGORITHMS
 
SET NUM_PLAYERS to 3

DECLARE string player1, player2, player3
DECLARE int rocksCount1, rocksCount2, rocksCount3
DECLARE string firstPlace, secondPlace, thirdPlace

WELCOME MESSAGE

FOR each of the 3 players:
    PROMPT for player name
    PROMPT for number of rocks collected
        IF rocks collected <= 0:
           DISPLAY warning message
            SET rocks count to 0

    IF all three rock counts are equal:
        DISPLAY tie message
    ELSE IF two players have equal and highest rock count:
        DISPLAY tie message
        DISPLAY third player in second
    ELSE:
        Determine highest rock count:
            SET firstPlace to player with highest rocks
            COMPARE remaining two for second and third place
            SET secondPlace and thirdPlace accordingly
        DISPLAY first, second and third places

    COMPUTE average = (rocksCount1 + rocksCount2 + rocksCount3) / 3.0
    DISPLAY average
    DISPLAY goodbye message
